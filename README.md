File Sync Script
This Python script synchronizes files in a target directory with a master file by comparing their checksums. If the checksum of a file does not match the checksum of the master file, it replaces the outdated file with the master file.

Requirements
Python 3.6 or higher
Basic understanding of file paths and directories
Installation
Make sure Python is installed on your system.

Download Python from python.org if it's not already installed.
Clone or download this repository to your local machine.

Setup
Before running the script, you'll need to modify the paths and file names to match your system's configuration.

Master Files: Define the paths to the master files you want to sync.

Target Directory: Define the directory where the files to be synced are located.

Update the Script
In the script, locate and modify the following variables:

base_directory: The base directory where your target files are stored.
settings_directory: The specific subdirectory containing the files you want to sync (e.g., settings_CloneFirmware).
master_core_char: The path to the master character file (e.g., core_char_2120070626.dat).
master_core_user: The path to the master user file (e.g., core_user_26284228.dat).
Example:

python
Copy code
# Base directory and settings directory
base_directory = r'C:\Users\someone\AppData\Local\CCP\EVE\d_program_files_(x86)_eve_tq_tranquility'
settings_directory = os.path.join(base_directory, 'settings_CloneFirmware')

# Paths to the master files
master_core_char = os.path.join(settings_directory, 'core_char_2120070626.dat')
master_core_user = os.path.join(settings_directory, 'core_user_26284228.dat')
How It Works
1. Checksum Calculation
The script computes the checksum of each file (using SHA-256 by default) in the target directory and compares it to the checksum of the master file.

2. File Synchronization
If a fileâ€™s checksum does not match the master file's checksum, the script replaces the file with the master file.
If the checksums are the same, the script will confirm that the file is already in sync and do nothing.
3. File Matching
The script looks for files in the target directory that match the following patterns:

Files starting with core_char_ (for character-related files).
Files starting with core_user_ (for user-related files).
Files must also have a .dat extension.
Running the Script
Open a terminal (or Command Prompt).

Navigate to the directory where the script is located.

Run the script with the following command:

bash
Copy code
python your_script_name.py
The script will process the files in the specified target directory, comparing their checksums with the corresponding master file, and replacing any outdated files.

Example Output
bash
Copy code
Checksum mismatch for core_char_123456.dat. Copying the master file.
core_char_123456.dat is already in sync with the master file.
Checksum mismatch for core_user_987654.dat. Copying the master file.
Customization
Change the Hash Algorithm: The script uses SHA-256 by default to calculate file checksums. If you want to use a different algorithm (e.g., MD5, SHA-1), you can modify the hash_algo parameter in the compute_checksum function.

File Pattern: If your target files have a different naming convention, update the file pattern in the sync_files function call. For example, change 'core_char_' to 'core_profile_'.

Troubleshooting
Permission Issues: Ensure the script has permission to read from and write to the target directory and master files.
File Not Found: Double-check that all file paths are correct and that the files exist at those locations.
